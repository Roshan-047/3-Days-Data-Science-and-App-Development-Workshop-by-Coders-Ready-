# 3-Days-Data-Science-and-App-Development-Workshop-by-Coders-Ready-
I attended this workshop by coders ready on data science, and build this project here

Day 1- It was my first time working with data science , and the mentor was so experience and he taught so well that even it was my first time i understood every concepts clearly and even implemented it. 
on day 1 i got familiar with all python concepts, imports, multiple libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib. Used mpl toolkit.basemap and using basemap learnt the implementation of maps and its topographies,
implemented map of india and plotted major cities using its geometrical coordinates.
Day 2- in continuation with the project we animated the path way from new delhi to london by taking multiple points in between the two coordinated line and ploted with using two different colours i.e. blue and red.
also learnt about nightshade property.
Day 3 - we implemented the earth orbit in our solarsystem by using multiple points in a elliptical form and plotting it on the screen using matplotlib. and used core implementation of numpy and pandas library and we concluded the workshop
